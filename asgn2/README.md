Assignment 2 A Little slice of pi
The object for this assignment is to implement a small number of mathematical functions (e x and p x), mimicking , and using them to compute the fundamental constants e and π.


BUILDING
'''
make  //to build the files and make the test harness ready to run
'''
RUNNING
Make sure your are in the correct directory. To check use pwd and ls to check if the nesscary files are in the same directory. Then run the below command.

IN this step you can use flags such as:
• -a : Runs all tests. 
• -e : Runs e approximation test.
 • -b : Runs Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe π approximation test. 
 • -m : Runs Madhava π approximation test. • -r : Runs Euler sequence π approximation test. 
 • -v : Runs Viète π approximation test. 
 • -n : Runs Newton-Raphson square root approximation tests.
